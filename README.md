# Resume Screening System

## Live Demo: <https://bharath-resume-screening.streamlit.app/>

## Project Overview
The Resume Screening System is an NLP-based application that automates the initial screening of resumes by comparing them with a given job description.
It ranks candidates based on textual similarity, skills, and experience to support faster and more accurate hiring decisions.

---

## Problem Statement
Recruiters often receive a large number of resumes for a single job opening, making manual screening time-consuming and inefficient.
This system automates resume evaluation by analyzing textual relevance between resumes and job requirements.

---

## Inputs
- Resume text (PDF or text format)
- Job description text

---

## Outputs
- Similarity score for each resume
- Ranked list of candidates

---

## Project Workflow (Pipeline)

1. Resume and job description texts are collected.
2. Text is preprocessed (lowercasing, removing symbols and stopwords).
3. TF-IDF converts text into numerical vectors.
4. Cosine similarity measures relevance between resumes and job description.
5. Skill-based and experience-based scores are applied.
6. Final scores are generated and resumes are ranked.

## Concept Understanding

### Term Frequency (TF)
Shows how often a word appears in a document.
Frequent skills in a resume indicate candidate expertise.

### Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)
Reduces the importance of very common words across resumes while increasing the weight of rare and meaningful terms.

### TF-IDF
Highlights important words that are frequent in a resume but not common across all resumes.

### Cosine Similarity
Measures similarity between two documents based on vector direction.
Value close to 1 means a strong match.
Value close to 0 means a weak match.

### Text Preprocessing
Removes noise and standardizes text before vectorization.

---

## Resume Ranking
The system computes cosine similarity scores and ranks resumes in descending order, with higher scores indicating better matches.

   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the project  
   python src/main.py

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NLP (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)
- Regex
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

---

## Future Improvements
- Add Streamlit web interface

---

## Why This Project Matters
Resume screening is one of the most time-consuming tasks in recruitment.
This project demonstrates how NLP techniques can automate candidate shortlisting.
It reduces manual effort and improves hiring efficiency.
The system is designed to be simple, scalable, and practical.

---

## Challenges Faced
- Handling unstructured resume text
- Extracting experience reliably using regex
- Balancing similarity, skill, and experience scores
- Preventing crashes due to missing or empty files

---

## Key Learnings
- Practical application of TF-IDF and cosine similarity
- Importance of modular and clean code design
- Error handling for real-world data
- Translating business problems into technical solutions

---

## How This Helps Recruiters
- Faster initial screening
- Objective ranking of candidates
- Reduced human bias
- Better focus on high-potential candidates
