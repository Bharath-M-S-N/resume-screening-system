# Resume Bullet Points – Resume Screening System

## Project: Resume Screening System (NLP-based)

- Built an NLP-based Resume Screening System that automatically ranks resumes against a job description using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.

- Implemented skill-based and experience-based scoring using keyword matching and regex extraction to improve candidate ranking accuracy beyond pure text similarity.

- Designed a modular Python pipeline with resume parsing (PDF/Text), preprocessing, similarity scoring, and robust error handling for real-world unstructured data.

- Automated resume shortlisting to reduce manual screening effort and improve recruiter efficiency in high-volume hiring scenarios.
