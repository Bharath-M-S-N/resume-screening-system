## Problem Statement

Recruiters manually screen hundreds of resumes for a single job opening,
which is time-consuming and prone to human bias.
There is a need for an automated system that can analyze resumes
and rank them based on their relevance to a given job description.

This project aims to build a Resume Screening System that compares
resume content with a job description using Natural Language Processing techniques.
The system will generate a similarity score and rank candidates accordingly.

## Inputs
- Resume text
- Job description text

## Outputs
- Similarity score between resume and job description
- Ranked list of resumes based on relevance
